# Dreamlayer

## Welcome to *my* project!

**Before** I say anything else, I want to explain why I want this project to be a reality
and what this site means.

- Althrough this project is focused on the specific hardware aspects, the goal is to make an interactive experience for all ages just using the walls around you.
- I do intend to one day make this into a reliable product that requires little set-up, if you just want it to work.
- Not only that, I want to have technology like this to be on the cheaper side of things, mainly due wanting this to be more into people's hands to experiment and use the spaces around them for any needs.

  If you're interested on adding more to this project, please contact me below:

```This is all I can think for use for this, regardless I hope this makes sense.```
