                        <h3>What makes Dreamlayer unique?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Dreamlayer isn't just another wall light - it's layered
                            art piece that blends depth, texture, and light into one
                            display. By using stacked panels and programmable 
                            illumination, it creates shifting visual effects that feel 
                            alive, not static. Instead of being a flat glow on your 
                            wall, Dreamlayer changes as you move through the room
                            , transforming ordinary walls into a living canvas.

                        <p>
                            Each Dreamlayer is carefully packaged and shipped within
                            1-2 business days of your order. Standard delivery typically
                            arrives within 5-7 business days in the U.S., with international
                            shipping times varying by region. From checkout to doorstep, 
                            you'll receive real-time tracking updates so you can follow
                            your Dreamlayer's journey.

                            We want every Dreamlayer to feel like it truly belongs in your 
                            space. If it doesn't, you have 30 days to return it in its original
                            condition for a full refund - no questions, no hassle. Your experience
                            should feel effortless from start to finish, and that includes making
                            a return as a simple as placing the order.
